SelfPublisher

STATUS:

under development

DESCRIPTION:

Simple to set up solution for self publishing on a wordpress website.
After installing the plugin an entry in the system menu is created that allows a user to create his own types of entries with how many custom fields he needs.
The idea is to allow a fast custom setup for wordpress. Since it creates custom post types, the rendering engine allows the new entries to be displayed out of the box on any theme.
It is also useful for technical users since theming the custom wordpress website is reduced to creating custom templates or modifying the css.

TECHNICAL DETAILS:

The settings page exposes a list of existing post types. Each can be edited in a modal window or removed. New types can be added.
The modal window uses javascript to render a list of elements, each containing an input field for the name of the field and a dropdown with supported types.
A description field will be added for the next version.
Once the save button is clicked, a json is sent via a post to an ajax handler in the plugin, that stores the new data. The plugin adds hooks to save the custom meta properly, as well as a display mechanism for custom fields.

NOT WORKING:

Creating custom post types from stored data.
Local server issue that forced us to put all php code in one file ( something with loading external php files we didn't have time to look into ).
No pre-render hook for custom fields in place.
Uninstall not working properly.

FUTURE PLAN:

A lot of refactoring. Use default wordpress styles. Fix bugs.

INSTALL STEPS:

- drop the contents of the archive in the plugins folder
- activate the plugin from wordpress
